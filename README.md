# lc3.vim

## Description

This plugin provides syntax highlighting support for the assembly language of the [LC-3 microprocessor](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3). It will also automatically detect files ending in the `.lc3` extension.

## Installation

Install this with your favorite plugin manager, or do it by hand if you're weird.

For example, [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) users would place

```
Plug 'zacharied/lc3.vim'
```

after `call plug#begin()` .

## Contributing
